## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- Initial production foundation: CLI-first hyperagent for building, fixing,
  verifying and shipping applications.
- Agent core: plan → act → observe → verify execution loop with self-healing,
  budgets, step journaling and resume.
- Tool ecosystem (28 tools): filesystem (read/write/patch/create/delete/list/
  search/glob/tree), repo intelligence (inspect/summarize/git state & diff),
  execution (shell/tests/lint/format/typecheck/build/logs/http), memory
  (search/remember/project-note), validation and browser.
- Layered memory: working, session, persistent project and procedural.
- Validation engine with auto-detected quality gates, evidence capture and a
  configurable definition of done.
- Playwright/Chromium browser subsystem: navigation, flows, forms, assertions,
  screenshots, console and network error capture, traces.
- Typer + Rich CLI: 20 command groups, JSON output mode, structured errors,
  stable exit codes, shell completion.
- Typed configuration with layered precedence, `--explain` provenance, secret
  references and a redaction pipeline.
- Plugin system: entry-point, user and project plugin discovery, tool/provider/
  gate registration.
- Packaging for Linux-first use: pipx/uv/pip install, cross-platform CI matrix,
  Homebrew and winget templates, PyInstaller standalone build recipe.
